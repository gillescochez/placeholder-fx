placeholder-fx
==============

Some input placeholder animated / toggled using CSS only.

Basically using the required attribute and the :valid pseudo selector to detect if 
the input/textarea as content and change the status or animate the placeholder element accordingly.

Doesn't work on IE, but there is a js fix which provides placeholder visibility toggling.

Didn't really try it and was just playing, still interesting to look at if you don't know the required / :valid trick.
